## Description

<br>

An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Social Network API uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM and Moment.js to format timestamps on query. Also, the API routes were tested using Insomnia.

<br>

## Usage
